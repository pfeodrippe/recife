= Recife

A model checker library in Clojure. REPLing Everything!!

See a video about it that I have presented at

== WARNING!!

This is very, very experimental, the code will certainly change and
there is no form of documentation whatsoever, besides, the code of
`recife.core` is a little bit messy yet. This is a prototype so
people who are interested can use the code and, hopefully, give
feedback.

I will continue to work on it in another branch until I have some
satisfactory organization (hope I have time!) and better backends
(maybe Electrum or TLA+).
